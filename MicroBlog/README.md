# What is Changed

This is my first Flask Project.

Improvement point of the original project in the lecture:
1. After adding an entry, it was unable to edit/delete.

Changes I made:
1. Add a new endpoint for edit
2. Add buttons of edit&delete

Improvement point of myself.
1. I used ObjectId to target the dataset. I didn't learn about uuid at this moment. I should use uuid instead of ObjectId directly. 
2. I used a few global variables. I was able to pass data through Jinja but at this moment, I didn't know how to so I used global variables.

As an improvement, I used uuid & not use global variables on my next project Habit Tracker.
