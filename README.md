# Flask-Projects
My flask projects. Studying the "Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2022" course on Udemy. 

First of all, I study by watching this course and coding together. 
After watching a full course, I think of myself as a user and think about which feature should be added.
Based on what I've learned, I implement those features in the flask projects. 
Detailed features that are added are listed on README.md
